Peace Corps volunteer (PCV) assigned to Guyana is working with local communities to educate deaf students. These students do not have access to various services to help them through schools. 

## Problem
Part of the PCV initiative is work with the Deaf Association of Guyana to discover how where deaf services are needed. 

## Idea
The proposed project is to identify homes where there are potential need of deaf services or someone in the home who is deaf so that 1) future PCVs can continue the work, 2) determine what type of services and 3)need must be facilitated and reporting back to Peace Corps.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution will be similar to our Ushahidi project. PCV onsite will gather data via GPS device or laptop, record information on each location where it is determine there is a deaf occupant, and display information collecting on a web page and all the data uploads and content added is part of a fluid solution.
