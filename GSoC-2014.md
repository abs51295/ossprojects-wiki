For GSoC 2014, our goal is to have projects that impacts users/communities by improving their duties/tasks with technology. The projects below are projects for Peace Corps volunteers (PCVs)and administrators. It is important that PCVs have tools that can help collect data and report back to PC headquarters on progress and status of their assignments. It's just as important for PC administrators/managers to track their PCVs activities and assignments.
