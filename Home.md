Welcome to Systers' open source projects page!

To support our efforts to inspire, guide and connect women in technology, Systers' open source projects engage our community through contributing in open source, collaborate with global community and learn and/or enhance their coding skills.  

We have been accepted and are participating in Google Summer of Code 2016. You can view a list of our [GSoC 2016 projects](GSoC-2016).

In order to engage with the community, you can sign up on [Systers Open Source Slack](http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/) and begin asking questions on how to get involved in GSoC in the #gsoc-questions channel.

**We are only accepting 22-25 proposals.**
