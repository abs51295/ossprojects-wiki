### Project Description
Peace Corps is looking to design a mobile app that will aid the Volunteer in sustaining life-saving malaria prevention tactics over their 2+ years of service. This includes sustained use of preventive meds, wearing of protective clothing and sleeping under a bed net.
 
The hope is to use the latest thinking in using technology to influence behavior to provide assistance to the 1,000â€™s of Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Malaria endemic regions of the world. We are interested in experimenting with all possible options including gamification, social sharing, and tracking within a mobile application.
 
Participants will be presented with two recent studies conducted by the CDC pertaining to use of preventative tactics by volunteers and their reasons for compliance or non-compliance. Participants will also be given access to experts at Peace Corps, State Dept. and the CDC to help understand the science of Malaria prevention and the findings of the recent research.

## Initial Design
There are many volunteers at the Peace Corps and PC works with colleges and universities in intern programs.  There will be an initial design team working on the interface and functional flow of the application. Once that team has initial design is complete (target March 5), we'll have access to that as well.
