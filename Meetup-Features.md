Systers used Meetup Everywhere for our global community. However, Everywhere was discontinued in December 2014. 

## Proposed Solution
We currently built a portal solution for our community as part of GSoC 2014. We'd like to have meetup feature part of our portal. Not sure if this will be developed as a separated application and integrated later, or build the feature into portal.

## Skill Level
The portal has some complexity architecture, so we'd like for students who want to participate in this project to be familiar with Python, and SQL.

## Repo
This will be a large integrated feature of Portal so will work from Portal repo. New enhancement definition coming soon...

**Development Environment:**
* Language: Python
* Framework: Django
* Difficulty: Intermediate and above

## Mentors
* [Ana Balica](http://ana-balica.github.io/) (Bali, traveling through Asia)
* More mentors TBA
