This project started from RHOK Atlanta June 2013 event helping Peace Corps (PC) volunteer located in Micronesia in developing local language. Currently, the Chuukese people have no written language. The PC volunteer needed a web application that would work offline (Internet access is scarce and low performance). The idea is that PC volunteers could take photos around town, upload them and add Chuukese and English translations. 

Peace Corp needs a web application specifically for all of their volunteer sites so something more generic is needed. Initial project was created in Ruby on Rails and would be great to continue this development.
