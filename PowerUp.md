A graduate team (includes a Syster) at Harvard Graduate School of Education came up with the idea to create a Female Empowerment App called PowerUp. It would be an educational choose-your-own-adventure game that allows young girls (12 to 14) to learn about reproductive health and self-esteem by navigating the life of their avatar. 

## Summary
Preadolescent girls need better options for reproductive health and self-esteem education. Preadolescents are at risk for possible pregnancy and spread of sexually transmitted infection (STI), yet very little information reaches preadolescents about risk and responsibility associated with sex. Additionally, preadolescents struggle with self-esteem, which makes them vulnerable to peer and media influence. Current trends in sexual activity among preadolescents impact the economy, hurt family cohesion, affect female education, and burden healthcare systems.
