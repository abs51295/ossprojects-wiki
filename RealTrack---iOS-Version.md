# RealTrack iOS Version

RealTrack is an Android smartphone application designed to facilitate day-to-day data collection by Peace Corps Volunteers in the field. The prototype was developed from RHOK (Random Hack of Kindness) and prototype is now on Google Play. Initial work by [Neeraj Rao](https://github.com/neeraj2608/realtrack). 

We are in the process of getting user feedback on the app and plan on making incremental adjustments as we move forward. We will use the Android version to define the requirements of the iOS version and start the iOS development.

**Here are some of the proposed features of the application:**
* Streamlined interface
* Automatic report generation of data emailed to user on demand (so available on a PC)
* Reminders to record data for activities making sure the PCV doesn't forget
* Recording meetings with local leaders
* Tweets to engender sense of accomplishment
* Ability to share images from phoneâ€™s gallery

**Development Environment**
* Language: XCode
* Framework: iOS SDK
* Difficulty: Novice to Intermediate
* Potential Mentors: TBA
_Note: For this project, you will be placed under Peace Corps development license for the duration of the project._
