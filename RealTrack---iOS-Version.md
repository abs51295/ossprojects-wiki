# RealTrack iOS Version

RealTrack is an Android smartphone application designed to facilitate day-to-day data collection by Peace Corps Volunteers in the field. The prototype was developed from RHOK (Randon Hack of Kindness) and prototype is now on Google Play. 

We are in the process of getting user feedback on the app and plan on making incremental adjustments as we move forward. We will use the Android version to define the requirements of the iOS version and start the iOS development.

Here are some of the proposed features of the application:

Streamlined interface
Automatic report generation of data emailed to user on demand (so available on a PC)
Reminders to record data for activities making sure the PCV doesn't forget
Recording meetings with local leaders
Tweets to engender sense of accomplishment
Ability to share images from phone’s gallery

**Development Environment**
* Language: Java
* Framework: Android SDK
