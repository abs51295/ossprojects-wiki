Systers use a customized version of Mailman 2. We would like to port our features to Mailman 3.  

The features that we want to port are: 

- Essay
- Stats for admins

Due to the complexity of this project, it would be good if the student was familiar with Python and SQL. Ideally, the student would be also familiar with Mailman or similar, but it is not mandatory. 

## Development Environment
* Language: Python, SQL
* Difficulty: Intermediate to Advanced

## Mentors
Ana Cutillas
