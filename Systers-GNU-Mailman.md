Systers GNU Mailman is our flaship open source project.  Systers emailing list uses GNU Mailman software for our email software. Systers has a customized version of GNU Mailman. 

Things to note:
1. You can read [past Systers GSoC projects](http://systers.org/systers-dev/doku.php/start).

2. All Systers GNU Mailman code is stored on [Systers Launchpad repository](https://launchpad.net/systers).


Systers will be upgrading to the latest version of GNU mailman and must add Systers code to the baseline code. This allows more analysis of GNU Mailman architecture and code.
1. Add Systers features to upgrade
