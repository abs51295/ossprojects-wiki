For GSoC 2014, our goal is to have projects that impacts users/communities by improving their duties/tasks with technology. We want to provide projects in 1)various development languages, 2) technologies and 3) challenges. Systers will still maintain our current wiki for resources, however, we have created a repository here on github (by popular demand) so that students/mentees can publish and store their code,  connect with other open source communities who use github, and learn how to store revisions of code like Git ([Try Git!](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)).

Some of the projects below are projects for [Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteers (PCVs)and administrators. It is important that PCVs have tools that can help collect data and report back to PC headquarters on progress and status of their assignments. It's just as important for PC administrators/managers to track their PCVs activities and assignments. Additionally, our organization, [Anita Borg Institute](http://anitaborg.org/) and Systers community have open source projects that will help our staff manage our volunteers and help our members collaborate better.
