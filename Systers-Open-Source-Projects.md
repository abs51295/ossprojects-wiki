### Peace Corps Projects GSoC 2014

1. **Online Picture Dictionary** with Mobile component. (Ruby on Rails)
>This project started from RHOK Atlanta June 2013 event helping Peace Corps (PC) volunteer located in Micronesia in developing local language. Currently, the Chuukese people have no written language. The PC volunteer needed a web application that would work offline (Internet access is scarce and low performance). The idea is that PC volunteers could take photos around town, upload them and add Chuukese and English translations. 

2. **Ushahidi Crowdsourcing** for PC volunteers in Azerbaijan. Read more about this project on [PC PCAZ Github](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/PCAZ) site.
