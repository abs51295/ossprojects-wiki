Systers, along with other sub-groups, have several channels where information is disseminated. A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography. 

Initial features:

1. Login and Admin dashboard by Systers and sub-groups

Would like to implement various levels of access, for example
* Level 5 (Admin all rights)
* Level 4 (Manage users and content)
* Level 3 (Manager content)
* Level 2 (Content contributor)
* Level 1 (Only view mode and comment)

2. Workspace available for Systers and each sub-group

Workspace includes the ability to:
* Entering Resources for scholarships, grants, interns, workshops, professional development, etc.
* Find a local meetup (currently using Meetup Everywhere has strict limitations)

3. Create social media template for sharing information
* Should be able to share resources, meetups and announcements via social media

Future enhancements:
Create application for more broader community portal.
