Systers, along with other sub-groups, have several channels where information is disseminated. A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography. Before rebranding and new website, ABI (Anita Borg Institute) had a section/pages for Systers and each subgroup (Latinas, LGBT, Black Women in Computing, TurkishWiC and ArabWiC). This allowed for subgroup members to find information specific to their groups. See screen shots below.

## Project ideas

### Port Systers Portal to Python3

Currently we support only Python 2, but all of our packages are Python2-3 compatible. So we would like to be able to run Systers Portal with latest Python3 version (and probably drop Python2).

**Skills needed**: Python, Django, experience with migrating Python2 projects to Python3.

**Complexity level**: Average

**Helpful resources**: [Python3 porting](http://python3porting.com/) and [this article](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/)

### Meetup integration

Systers used a platform of Meetup.com called Everywhere, but it was discontinued from last December 2014. It was FREE and it was perfect for Systers, because it created a global Meetup, and members were able to create local Meetups based on the global Meetup and have more control over their particular Meetup. We wanted it to be part of the Portal and not a standalone. More details on this project will be added later.

**Skills needed**: Python, Django, Meetup API

**Complexity level**: Average to advanced
