Systers, along with other sub-groups, have several channels where information is disseminated. A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography. 

## Initial features:

### Login and Admin dashboard by Systers and sub-groups

Would like to implement various levels of access, for example
* Level 5 (Admin all rights)
* Level 4 (Manage users and content)
* Level 3 (Manager content)
* Level 2 (Content contributor)
* Level 1 (Only view mode and comment)


### Workspace available for Systers and each sub-group

Workspace includes the ability to:
* Enter resources (scholarships, grants, interns, workshops, professional development, etc.)
* Create/Find a local or global meetups (currently using Meetup Everywhere has limitations)
* See past events

### Create social media template for sharing information

Should be able to share resources, meetups and announcements via social media.


## Future enhancements:
Create application for more broader community portal.
