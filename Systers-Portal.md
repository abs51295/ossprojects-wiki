Systers, along with other sub-groups, have several channels where information is disseminated. A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography. Before rebranding and new website, ABI (Anita Borg Institute) had a section/pages for Systers and each subgroup (Latinas, LGBT, Black Women in Computing, TurkishWiC and ArabWiC). This allowed for subgroup members to find information specific to their groups. See screen shots below.

## Initial features:

### Login and Admin dashboard by Systers and sub-groups

Would like to implement various levels of access, for example
* Level 5 (Admin all rights)
* Level 4 (Manage users and content)
* Level 3 (Manager content)
* Level 2 (Content contributor)
* Level 1 (Only view mode and comment)


### Workspace available for Systers and each sub-group

Workspace includes the ability to:
* Enter resources (scholarships, grants, interns, workshops, professional development, etc.)
* Create/Find a local or global meetups (currently using Meetup Everywhere has limitations)
