In the past, students have set up a framework for automated tests of Systers Mailman Project. The main goal of the project has been to have reusable and automated scripts for regression testing.  Our students created a series of web-based [Selenium WebDriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) scripts covering thoroughly the specific features added by Systers to the Mailman project. 

This year, we want to expand this testing automation for all of the projects. Students will work to setup environment for all the projects listed above as well as work with the students on those projects. A lot of collaboration with other students, mentors, Project Managers, org administrator.

You can read last year's student's work about [Testing Automation](http://systers.org/systers-dev/doku.php/olga_maciaszek-sharma:gsoc2013).

This year, Java or Python may be the language of choice and it depends on which projects will be tested with the automation testing. We have various web projects (VMS, Portal, Systers Mailman) for which we need to write tests. 

You are advised to write simple tests using Selenium and see how Selenium is used for Automated Testing.
You can share it in a separate github folder and attach its link in the proposal.
