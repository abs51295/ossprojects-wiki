In the past, students have set up a framework for automated tests of Systers Mailman Project. The main goal of the project has been to have reusable and automated scripts for regression testing. [Pyunit](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) test framework was used. Our students created a series of web-based [Selenium WebDriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) scripts covering thoroughly the specific features added by Systers to the Mailman project. 

This year, we want to expand this testing automation for all of the projects. Students will work to setup environment for all the projects listed above as well as work with the students of those projects. A lot of collaboration with other students, mentors, Project Managers, org administrator.
