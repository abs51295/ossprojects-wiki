Initial projects were for a customization of the [Ushahidi Platform](http://ushahidi.com/products/ushahidi-platform) for Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Azerbaijan. We want to make this more open for other locations with enhancements, but also work on issues and existing enhancements.

[Background Information and Initial Code](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/PCAZ)

## From Peace Corp Volunteer
Starting in September 2013, Peace Corps Azerbaijan rolled out an organization and resource mapping project. Initially, the project addressed the issue of information sharing about current and former PCV projects throughout the regions of Azerbaijan. From there, the mapping team realized the potential of an interactive crowdsourcing map resource, and the focus changed accordingly. 

### Problem
Volunteers do a lot of work at site (the village or town where they're placed), and the information about these projects are often either 1) not shared/documented or 2) stored away on Peace Corps' server at the main office in the capital. Not having accessible information about volunteers' projects and resources limits PC staff's knowledge about the work PCVs are doing AND it limits collaboration between PCVs and the organizations they work with.

### Idea
To have an up to date, user-friendly, interactive database where PCVs could enter information about their projects and resources so: 1) PCVs can share ideas/information about good practices 2) PCVs and their organizations are more likely to collaborate with each other and 3) PCVs can share information about their sites to ease future volunteers into their work in their new communities.

### Solution
Crowdmap. Allowing PCVs to crowdsource information about their projects and resources visually onto a map allows a user-friendly, interactive database that sustains itself by volunteers putting information into and receiving helpful information from the map.

### Action
PC Azerbaijan assembled a mapping team. It includes our Director of Programming and Training, Rita Mahoney, a PCVL (myself) and two PCVs working in the regions, Amy Baldwin and Mary Kaczka. We created the report forms on Crowdmap based on our project's goal of organization and resource mapping. We tested a "beta version" in December by asking a handful of PCVs in the regions to try to submit forms based on their current projects. We got their feedback on the interface, the utility of the tool, and ideas for improvement. We incorporated those ideas into our report forms on Crowdmap, sent the technical questions/troubleshooting issues raised to Patrick at HQ, and conducted an hour long training for a group of 45 PCVs at their Mid-Service Conference at the end of January. (See attachments for session plan and PPT).

### Where we go from here
What we need now is to make sure that this tool is user-friendly enough so PCVs don't feel like this is just another required form to fill out. The idea is to eliminate the paper trail, not make it bigger. It seems to me like the biggest issue PCVs have with Crowdmap right now is that it's slow. Me, although admittedly not a tech savvy person, think this is a combination of poor internet connections in the regions and Crowdmap being overloaded by too much information in the map layer. What we think would help is if we tailor Crowdmap to fit really exactly what we want to use it for. PCVs are hooked on the idea of mapping their projects and resources, but they are frustrated and therefore inhibited by slow uploads, error messages and losing information they thought they entered on Crowdmap. If we can take away some of the features on Crowdmap that we're not using for this project and limit the map layer so it's just Azerbaijan (not a world map), we may be able to reduce the amount of congestion on the site and make the whole site user-friendly for PCVs. 

### GitHub
I've uploaded our requests for modifying Crowdmap to fit our needs onto Peace Corps' GitHub page. The project is called PCAZ, and you can see my requests under the "Issues" tab. 

### Additional Information
All in all, PCAZ's Mapping team thinks that Peace Corps Volunteer work can benefit greatly by updating the type of technology we're using to report and share information. The developing world's technology is changing rapidly--all of my students in my village are using smartphones! Therefore, a project like this seems to be coming at the right time. The reality is that we still have to keep in mind the fact that PCVs are working in remote areas, often with unreliable internet connections and limited tech capacity. We recognize the need to modify the projects we roll out to suit the reality of working in remote areas. This is where we need help because we get in over our heads relatively quickly!

If successful in Azerbaijan, this mapping project has a lot of room to expand. 

1) We'd like to be able to make is user-friendly enough for local PC staff to use for site development--deciding which towns/villages to place PCVs in based on first-hand information from PCVs who actually experienced living and working there. With an increase in familiarity and comfort with online portals comes a decrease in the inefficiency of old databases on our server that are far less likely to be accessed.    

2) The more exposure and experience PCVs have with crowdsourcing information, the more likely they are to incorporate it into their projects at site. The potential that crowdsourcing has in developing communities for democratizing information, giving a greater number of people a voice in the decisions being made above them, teaching people about maps and visually representing data etc...The opportunities are endless!

3) Again, if successful, we'd like to make the Crowdmap project something that could be recreated at other posts in other Peace Corps countries.
